  proseA: 'Starting back at school, Rob always had a passion for automating things, even if it was just battery powered. He couldn\'t wait until he could automate things in his own house. This time running off the mains! After graduating back in 2011, automating his flat was naturally his first major personal project starting in 2013, turning into a four year project. He never got bored with this.',
  proseB: 'Alongside the home automation obsession, and again I suppose naturally after his love of tunes, he designed a way of accessing his old music archived on a decommissioned and dusty server he used to run for his Uni mates. Rob wrote an AWS Lambda middleware-supported site with a React + Redux front end from scratch. And loved every minute of it.',
  proseC: 'As with the professional portfolio, Rob has written up some bits and bobs about his personal projects too. Click through if you fancy reading a little more.'

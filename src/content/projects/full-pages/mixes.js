    'As you may have already gathered, Rob has always loved his music. This love extended into manipulating music and eventually mixing it together during his first year of University when he started to experiment with mixing software.',
    'Initially, mixing on software using a keyboard and mouse with VirtualDJ was fun but ultimately not practical. He decided to buy a MIDI controller to help control the software in real-time whilst mixing tracks together, eventually buying an external sound card and Numark mixer for real hands-off laptop experience.

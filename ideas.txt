For this site, I could use one of these bad boys (best of the bunch I reckon):
- https://html5up.net/solid-state
- https://html5up.net/helios

Ideas:
- Rob Butcher
- Software Engineer
- Audiophile
- Home Automation Maniac (<something else?> you'll be questioned on this so make it good! DevOps Maniac?)

- Can then have each project* I've worked on with: title; 5-6 words about main achievement; tech worked with; time on project
	- maybe just the top section is high level about the Software Engineering things I've done with a 'Learn More >' or 'CV >' button going to a separate page to detail these projects in the style on the line above
- Explanation of DevOps flow used to deploy this website, mentioning CloudFormation and CodePipeline
	- Short 30 second video made on iMovie to show me editing dev branch to add new 'project article*', pipeline, test URL, merge on Github, pipeline, prod URL
- A link to my Github for HomeAutomation - maybe even short video of lights changing? Timelapse?
- DJ section with music loves and link to a few mixes and some of my fav mixes by other artists
 - 'HEAR SOME OF HIS OLD SCHOOL MIXES' link on Homepage should list all artists I like, some of their mixes and not just my mixes
 - Leads on to link to private project I've worked on, React music app

Make it a fun site with fun language - a place people want to read on.
